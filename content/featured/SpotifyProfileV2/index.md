A real-time face detection application built using Python. Utilizes OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers to detect human faces in video streams or webcam input. 

This project is perfect for beginners exploring computer vision and AI, demonstrating how face detection works under the hood. It can be easily extended for tasks like emotion recognition, face recognition, or attendance systems using facial features.
